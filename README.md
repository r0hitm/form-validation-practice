# Form Validation Practice

Client-side form validation in JavaScript using Constraint Validation API and HTML5.

In this project, I have used the Constraint Validation API to validate the form. The Constraint Validation API is a set of interfaces which provides a way to validate form fields and gives more control over the validation process.

Inspired by TOP's [Form Validation Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-form-validation-with-javascript).
